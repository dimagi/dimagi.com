Since Sept 2013, Dimagi has been collaborating with its partners St. Johnâ€™s 
Research Institute to apply CommCare to help auxiliary nurses and other 
health workers identify and manage cases of GBV. CommCare helps the health 
workers follow tested, standardized protocols and inform survivors of their 
rights and options, provide counseling messages, and facilitate support services. 
CommCare reduces the burden of paper-based reporting and increases adherence to 
tested protocols that accurately screen for GBV.
