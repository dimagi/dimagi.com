    Why did we create the business development toolkit?
  {% endblocktrans %}
</h5>

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
    Developing a business development pipeline from scratch is difficult
    and time intensive. As a social enterprise and certified Benefit
    Corporation, we are committed to helping our partners achieve
    impact&mdash;whether that is with our technology platform, CommCare,
    or by sharing resources that could help improve a projectâ€™s deliverables.
    We developed this toolkit with the latter in mind. By releasing this
    toolkit, we hope to assist organizations in developing a business
    development process efficiently, so they can focus on what matters
    most: delivering services to those who need it most.
