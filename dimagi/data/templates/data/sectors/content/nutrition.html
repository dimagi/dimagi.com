      Malnutrition is disproportionately prevalent in poor,
      rural regions and developing countries. Nutrition efforts
      are often coordinated via large, integrated paper-based
      systems, and often lack real-time data.

      A variety of nutrition programs exist that can be supported
      and augmented with mobile technology to reduce the issues
      resulting from the abovementioned limitations. Examples of
      these types of programs include Growth Monitoring and
      Promotion (GMP), Community-based Management of
      Acute Malnutrition (CMAM), and Positive Deviance/Hearth (PD/H).
