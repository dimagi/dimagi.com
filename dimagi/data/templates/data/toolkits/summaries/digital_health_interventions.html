    The digital health interventions checklist summarizes the ways in which mobile technologies aid each aspect of
    an mHealth program: Clients, Healthcare Providers, Health System Managers, and Data Services. A comprehensive outline of
    the program – from personal health tracking to facility management –  provides common understanding and alignment between
    parties, as well as opportunities for a standard measure of effectiveness between different digital healthcare programs.
    From the WHO, “this Classification framework aims to promote an accessible and bridging language for health program planners
    to articulate functionalities of digital health implementations.”
