      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Billing Cycle: The periodic plan fee for our Services will be billed
        each calendar month unless and until you cancel your Plan. We reserve
        the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, if your
        payment has not successfully settled, or to enforce a minimum
        subscription length.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Cancellation: You may cancel your Subscription Plan anytime by

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        (a) you violate these Terms or any other agreement between you and

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        If you are engaged in any activities described above, we may be able
        to provide you with advance notice via the email address associated
        with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact
        you and give you the opportunity to export Your Data from our Services,
        but we cannot guarantee that we will provide such advance notice, as we
        may need to terminate your access to the Services immediately under
        certain circumstances (including those described below). If we are able to provide you with such advance notice and after delivery of such notice you fail to cease participating in such activities, we may terminate or suspend your access to the Services indefinitely.

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        (c) we are prohibited from doing so by law.
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Upon termination for any reason, you agree to destroy all copies of the Software in your possession.

If we do so, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to give you prior notice so that you can export Your Data from our systems.

        These Terms, together with the
        <a href="{{ privacy_url }}">Privacy Policy</a>,
        the <a href="{{ aup_url }}">Business Agreement</a>,
        the <a href="{{ ba_url }}">Acceptable Use Policy</a>,, and the other
        documents and materials referenced herein or otherwise published by
        Dimagi from time to time governing use of the Services, constitute the
        entire agreement between you and Dimagi with respect to the subject
        matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or
        contemporaneous agreements, understandings, or terms and conditions
        applicable to the subject matter of these Terms except as otherwise
        agreed in writing between you and Dimagi. These Terms create no third

        Waiver, Severability & Assignment
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Dimagi's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so at a later date or time. If any portion of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dimagi may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

    </h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on the Dimagi's website. If a revision, in Dimagi's sole discretion, is material, we will notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the email address associated with your account).  You are responsible for checking these postings regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Agreement. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you may not access or otherwise use the Services.
