      Agricultural extension and advisory is one of the most researched
      and proven techniques of improving yields and incomes for farmers.
      Trained agents visit communities to ensure the dissemination of current
      best practice, helping organize cooperatives or implement secondary programs.

      Developing countries continue to spend large sums of resources
      promoting agriculturally led development through agricultural
      extension work. However, these agricultural workers are expected
      to travel extensively across their countries while ensuring they
      maintain consistent and high quality work â€“ a nearly impossible task.
      Furthermore, agents receive limited training, resulting in short,
      infrequent visits where the complexities of agricultural issues are
      not easily addressed and key steps in farmer advising process are skipped.
