      Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global issue that refers to physical,
      sexual, psychological, and economic harm resulting from discrimination
      against a person on the basis of gender.

      The majority of people who experience GBV are women, and approximately
      70% of women worldwide encounter violence in their lifetime. While the
      most common form of GBV experienced by women is inflicted by an intimate
      partner, GBV can also occur in a variety of practices, such as early
      (childhood) marriage, female feticide, violence during pregnancy, female
      genital mutilation, honor killings, dowry murder, human trafficking,
      prostitution, and sexual violence in conflict, including using rape as
      a weapon of war (UNiTE, 2009).

      In order to reduce GBV prevalence, governments and organizations around
      the world are leading efforts to prevent and respond to GBV. Legal
      frameworks to protect against common forms of GBV now exist in many
      countries, while public fervor following high-profile GBV cases has
      also driven forward legislative and social action. Yet even with widespread
      support, implementing anti-GBV initiatives has been fraught with challenges.
      Private and public sector entities are actively seeking innovative responses
      to effectively prevent and address GBV in various countries around the world.
