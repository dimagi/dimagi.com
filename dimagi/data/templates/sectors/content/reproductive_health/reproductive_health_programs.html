    Reproductive health programs often rely on difficult-to-manage
    paper-based records systems to track patients, commodities,
    appointments, and adherence to prescriptions, which can result

      Mobile applications enable CHWs, supervisors, and project managers

      Real-time data can be used to improve programs by informing procurement
      of the commodities women wish to use and monitoring progress over
      time of unmet need within a project.
