        "with Dimagi to develop a customized, mobile health (mHealth) CommCare "
        "application for the governmentâ€™s frontline health workers. Since its "
        "pilot deployment of 10 users, the ReMiND project has successfully "
        "matured from an initial proof of concept to a scaled mobile tool for "
        "more than community health workers covering a population of "
        "over 300,000."
