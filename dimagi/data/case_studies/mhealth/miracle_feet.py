        "With funding from a $1M grant from Google.org, MiracleFeet commissioned "
        "Dimagi to create a universal tool to track treatment and program data "
        "for clubfoot, a common and treatable birth defect historically overlooked "
        "in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Currently, only one in "
        "five children globally has access to careâ€”making it a leading cause of "
        "physical disability worldwide. In ten years, MiracleFeet has developed "
        "systems and partnerships to treat clubfoot in 27 countries, where "
        "over 70,000 new cases occur each year. "
        "MiracleFeet selected CommCare to create a streamlined data collection "
        "tool, the Clubfoot Administration System (CAST), in support of its growing "
        "global network of clinics and providers who are increasing access to this "
        "critical treatment. Ninety-five percent of MiracleFeet-supported clinics "
        "have adopted the application, with CAST now in use in 371 clinics across "
        "29 countries, storing nearly 41,000 patient records that document full "
        "treatment progress and outcomes."
