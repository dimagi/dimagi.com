    In 2016 Dimagi was awarded an innovation grant from the
    Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) in Tanzania.
    Building on the success of mLabour in India, Dimagi will
    leverage the HDIF grant to adapt mLabour to the Tanzanian
    context and build upon its impact through two tracks:
    Adaption & Validation and Diffusion.

    Adaptation & Validation: Dimagi, in partnership with FHI 360
    and other local research partners, will conduct focused
    user-centered design activities and engage a wide range of
    stakeholders to understand the requirements for scaling mLabour
    throughout Tanzania. During the first year of the project,
    Dimagi will conduct an initial 3-month study to validate the safety,
    usability, and suitability of mLabour. In the second year,
    additional studies will be conducted to assess how quality
    of care is impacted through the use of mLabour.

    Diffusion: Through the Diffusion Track,
    Dimagi aims to deploy mLabour to five organizations in Tanzania,
    spanning both the private and public sector.
    Diffusion activities will include capacity building of two Tanzanian
    technical organizations to support mLabour,
    engagement with a range of private and public providers,
    and engagement with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.
