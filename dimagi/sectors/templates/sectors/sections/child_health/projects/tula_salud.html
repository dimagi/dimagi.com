{% block description %}{% blocktrans %}
  TulaSalud’s mHealth program in Guatemala, KAWOK, uses CommCare for its
  maternal and neonatal care application, in addition to others for
  auxiliary nurse services, community surveying, and malaria monitoring
  and treatment. Features include remote decision support, SMS alerts,
  and local language customization, and incorporating open-source
  products such as Google Earth for GPS tracking. A central function of
  the app is to strengthen Guatemala’s Zero Hunger Pact to reduce chronic
  and seasonal child malnutrition and child deaths among indigenous
  communities.
