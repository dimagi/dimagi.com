{% block description %}{% blocktrans %}
  D-Tree International designed a CommCare application while providing
  technical assistance to the USAID-funded “Integrated (HIV Effect)
  Migration and Positive Action for Community Transformation” (IMPACT)
  project. This project aims to improve the quality of life of orphans
  and vulnerable children in three target districts in Malawi. The
  application functions as a job aid to health surveillance assistants
  (HSAs), providing decision support to accurately treat sick children
  and follows Malawi’s government-designated IMCI protocol.
