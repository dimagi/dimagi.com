{% block description %}{% blocktrans %}
  In collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
  and University College of London, Malaria Consortium implemented inSCALE
  to demonstrate that government-led Integrated Community Case Management
  (iCCM) can improve healthcare services and expand coverage in Mozambique.
  The project uses CommCare to strengthen communication between community
  health workers (CHWs) and health facility supervisors, and with heavy
  involvement of the Ministry of Health. InSCALE has the potential to expand
  into other areas of the health system, with the goal of improved
  diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of disease throughout Mozambique.
