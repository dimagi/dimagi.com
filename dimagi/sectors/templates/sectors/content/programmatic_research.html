      Universities and organizations conducting field-based international
      research face unique challenges with data collection, monitoring,
      and program implementation. Research teams have to address
      coordination and integration of multiple paper-based tools,
      field deployment organizations, training of local staff and a
      variety of country-specific logistical considerations. The
      team is often only on-site for a short amount of time, and
      then may need to manage long term initiatives remotely.
