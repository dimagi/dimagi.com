    Students and teachers alike require safe and healthy learning spaces
    in order to thrive. With CommCare, implementers and Ministries of
    Education can record and track school-specific data, monitor
    improvements on-site, and provide targeted recommendations and
    reminders at the school level or across multiple schools.
