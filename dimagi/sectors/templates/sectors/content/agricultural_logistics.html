      Modern supply chain tools require heavy investments into training,
      computer infrastructure, and communications which developing
      countries may not be able to afford with closed source or custom
      development solutions.

      Inefficient power supplies, poor internet penetration rates,
      and high capital costs mean that most systems used in developed
      countries are not transposable to low-resource settings,
      often times leading to stock outs of important agricultural
      inputs. The need is clear for low cost, robust platforms
      capable of helping alleviate issues related to logistics,
      distribution and management of food systems.
