    Dimagi’s last mile value-chain systems, which have been deployed
    nationally in several countries for reducing stock outs of health
    supplies, can also be used to manage input distribution, cold
    chain of perishable goods, and warehouse receipt systems at
    lower cost than complex custom built systems. These costs are
