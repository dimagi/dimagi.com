  <strong>{% trans "Problem" %}</strong>:
  {% blocktrans %}
    Many maternal and newborn health programs are built on a foundation
    that relies heavily on access to clinics or hospitals, particularly
    when it comes to referrals for high-risk patients, burdening CHWs who
    often encounter difficulties in identifying emergency symptoms and working
    within inadequate and complex referral systems.

      Forms enable CHWs to use standardized,
      complex workflows to identify symptoms in
      mothers and newborns that require emergency care.

      Case sharing enables CHWs to immediately send medical
      information directly to clinicians at the referral facility
      and improve lines of communication between field and clinical work.
