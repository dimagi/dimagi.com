    Most mHRs are developed during crises, rather than before,
    limiting training and evaluation. Current mHRs focus on a
    single functionality even though several integrated
    functionalities are needed. Current mHRs lack methods
    to allow data sharing within and between HROs, and can
    be inhibited by mobile network failures.

      CommCareâ€™s application building tools enable non-programmers
      to configure and deploy mobile applications with point-of-service
      functions, and remotely update applications instantly.

      mHRs built with CommCare are interoperable via MOTECH with other
      tools built by HROs. This enables apps to be tested prior to a crisis,
      and reduces complications arising from multiple data systems that must
      be coordinated with different parties.

      HIPPA compliant tools enable HROs to selectively and securely share
      data on protected networks.
