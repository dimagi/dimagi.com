    Women may travel many miles only to reach a clinic and learn
    that the contraception they desire or need is out of stock.
    They may also be required to travel back for follow-up
    appointments after certain procedures, such as abortions or
    IUD insertions, even when they arenâ€™t experiencing any
    complications.

      SMS notifications give women advance notice of stock-outs,
      so they can plan to visit another clinic or wait until
      commodities have been restocked before traveling.

      SMS interactions allow CHWs to communicate across distances
      with their patients, so women can be reminded of
      appointments and prescriptions, as well as alert their
      CHW to any complications they may be experiencing.
