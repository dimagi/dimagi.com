            Dimagi was founded in 2002 out of the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology Media Lab. While volunteering for an electrical
            engineering class, Jonathan Jackson, co-founder and CEO, met
            Dr. Vikram Kumar, co-founder and chief medical officer, who was
            completing his masters thesis at the MIT Media Lab and working
            on an early version of Dimagi.

            Kumar wanted to build a company that combined global health
            and technology, but had not yet decided how. With Jacksonâ€™s
            help, the two focused on developing software for low-resource
            settings and started building among the first mobile solutions
            for frontline health programs in developing countries.

            Today, Dimagi continues to operate on the foundation that
            mobile solutions are key to improving the quality and
            efficiency of global development programs. While we got our start
            in health care, we work across sectors today with organizations
            of all sizes.
