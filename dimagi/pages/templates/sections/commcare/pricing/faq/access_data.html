  Can I access data I’ve collected in CommCare after pausing my subscription?

{% block answer %}{% blocktrans %}
  After pausing your subscription, you will not have access to the data in 
  your CommCare project space. Your data, however, is securely saved and 
  immediately available anytime you re-upgrade to a paid subscription. If you 
  need to work with data during the time you’ve paused your subscription, we 
  recommend exporting your data and saving it externally before pausing your plan.
