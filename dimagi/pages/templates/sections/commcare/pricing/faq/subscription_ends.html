  Can I pause my CommCare subscription?

{% block answer %}{% blocktrans %}
  Yes! You can pause your subscription at any time. Pausing a subscription 
  stops billing and removes access to the Applications, Reports, Data, and 
  Messaging sections of CommCareHQ. Note that your pause will only go into 
  effect at the end of your current payment period. Paused subscriptions 
  can be re-upgraded to a paid subscription plan at any time.
