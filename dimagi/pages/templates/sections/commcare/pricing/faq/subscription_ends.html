  Can I pause my CommCare subscription?
{% endblocktrans %}{% endblock %}

{% block answer %}{% blocktrans %}
  Yes! You can pause your subscription at any time after the initial
  duration of your plan. Pausing your subscription stops billing and
  removes your access to the Applications, Reports, Data, and Messaging
  sections of CommCareHQ. Paused subscriptions have a 30-day minimum, after
  which you can restart your subscription at any time.
