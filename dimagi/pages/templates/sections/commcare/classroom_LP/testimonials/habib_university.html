    “It was a pleasure and privilege to host Dev More from Dimagi
    to talk about Commcare in my 'Health Communication’ course held
    at Habib University during spring semester 2022 in Pakistan.
    The country is facing a myriad of health issues and CommCare’s
    technological infrastructure and user-friendly design can be
    significantly instrumental in reducing the gap between healthcare
    providers and communities. I highly recommend CommCare for wide
    scale use in Pakistan!”
