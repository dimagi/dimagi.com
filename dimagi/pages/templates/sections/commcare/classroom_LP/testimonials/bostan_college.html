        “Commcare is hands-down the most versatile & user-friendly 
        digital health platform for practitioners and educators. 
        I have embraced CommCare to facilitate group exercises for 
        university learners ranging from undergraduate business 
        students learning about mobile technology and social impact, 
        to graduate public-health students with global health specializations.
        Dimagi has a wealth of tutorials and guides, and their product 
        team is incredibly responsive and supportive to educators. ”
