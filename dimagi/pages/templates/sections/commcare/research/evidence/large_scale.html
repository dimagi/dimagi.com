        “We recently used CommCare for electronic data collection and monitoring in
        a large multi-site longitudinal study to evaluate the impact of HIV
        interventions in two US cities. Studies of this magnitude and complexity
        are always accompanied by challenges. Thanks to thoughtful input from
        the Dimagi team on the front end and the robustness and flexibility
        of the CommCare system, the development of data collection protocols
        to meet our needs and data collection were not part of those challenges.”
