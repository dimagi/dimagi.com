        “CommCare has streamlined our ability to collect, review, 
        and analyze data across various projects, including child 
        nutrition surveillance and type 2 diabetes management. The 
        intuitive user interface makes it simple to train our team 
        of community health workers, and the ability to incorporate 
        decision-support protocols and branching logic within 
        CommCare has allowed them to provide services with 
        remote physician supervision typically reserved for 
        more highly trained personnel.”
