        Longitudinal Cohort Study On Ear Biometrics For Patient ID & Tracking in Zambia

        “We created forms in CommCare that helped us track infants longitudinally,
        capturing ear data every month.  Based on the way we were able to set up
        registration, we could send out automatic reminders to patients when
        they were due at the clinic for their next follow-up, as well as
        auto-populate the correct form based on the infant’s date of birth
        captured on registration.  Since this study was aimed at determining
        ear growth over the course of the first 9 months of life, we used
        specific follow-up forms to group our data for analysis”
