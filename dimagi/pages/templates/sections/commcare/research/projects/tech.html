        CommCare can not only support your data collection needs but serve
        as an effective intervention management tool. The digital health
        domain has many unanswered questions around messaging, intensity,
        structure, and medium, all of which researchers are exploring using
        CommCare. Send behavior change messaging via SMS and record its
        effects with data collection workflows. Administer services to
        subjects and record the outcomes at the same time. Messaging tools
        can reach people where they are regardless of device types and
        CommCareâ€™s powerful form logic can present intervention and service
        delivery protocols based on the information the app collects. Systems
        can even be built to collect digital consent at the point of service.
