        Longitudinal studies in which subjects may be observed with data
        collected over multiple timepoints is where CommCare’s data
        collection capabilities can truly shine. CommCare allows
        researchers to check in with the same subjects over time and
        easily collect and sort all data by each subject’s unique ID.
        Additionally, researchers can predefine when data need to be
        collected, and CommCare can facilitate clean and timely data
        collection with preset notifications and reminders. These features
        make CommCare invaluable to subject tracking and data management,
        reducing the need to spend efforts following up, collating, and
        cleaning survey data on the back end.
