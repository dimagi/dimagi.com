        Data collected directly from a program’s beneficiaries and workers can
        be incredibly useful in evaluating the program’s effectiveness. CommCare
        can serve as a reliable platform to collect those data quickly and
        accurately by allowing you to employ a range of question formats
        (e.g. text, GPS coordinate, audio, etc.) and establish rock-solid workflows
        with intelligent display logic and validation conditions. These data can
        then be viewed and tracked in real time via integrations with a variety
        of data visualization tools, such as Tableau and PowerBI, or exported in
        CSV or Excel formats for analysis in commonly used tools such as STATA and R.
