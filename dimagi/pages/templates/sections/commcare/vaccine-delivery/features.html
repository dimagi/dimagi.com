            We developed the Dimagi Vaccine Solution as a set of six micro-applications
            that can be configured and deployed independently. Each micro-application is
            designed to address a different immunization challenge and is interoperable
            with other health systems. This gives your program the flexibility to use
            only what’s relevant to the needs of your program and local health
            information systems.
