            Immunizations are some of the most cost-effective and important
            public health tools available. We must maintain our focus on the
            equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines while also restoring previous
            rates of routine immunization, which have fallen drastically since
            the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to support progress on
            both COVID-19 and routine immunization in parallel, Dimagiâ€™s Vaccine
            Solution equips organizations and governments with tools to identify
            gaps in immunization, combat vaccine hesitancy, and deliver vaccines
            to communities through capable networks of frontline health workers.
