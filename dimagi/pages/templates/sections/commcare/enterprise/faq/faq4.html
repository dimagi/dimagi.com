    We do not have a central ICT4D team, how can we roll 
    out a centralized system across our projects/country offices?

      You donâ€™t need a formal, centralized ICT4D team in order to have 
      an Enterprise contract! We only need one person to serve as a 
      point of contact for the subscription for issues related to 
      billing, granting licenses to projects, etc. Otherwise, we 
      are happy to work with a group of regional leaders on our 
      quarterly Customer Success calls, which we have found is a 
      great way to help foster cross-team and cross-country collaboration.
