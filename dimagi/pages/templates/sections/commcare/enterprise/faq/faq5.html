    We are not a large team compared to organizations like 
    CRS. Is an Enterprise subscription still an option for me?

      Absolutely! The Enterprise offering is meant for any customer who 
      wants to institutionalize the use of a mobile tool in a cost-effective, 
      sustainable way. Even if you have as few as five projects that would 
      need their own project space, this solution can work for you. In fact, 
      smaller organizations may find it easier to institutionalize the use 
      of CommCare, since there are fewer staff members globally to train.
