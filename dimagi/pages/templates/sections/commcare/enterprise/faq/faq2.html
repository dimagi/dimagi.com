    Every project space included in our Enterprise subscription includes all of 
    our features. Additionally, the feature-set of our Enterprise offering is 
    aligned towards creating organizational value, which includes capabilities like the 
    <a href="https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/Enterprise+Features"
       target="_blank">Enterprise Dashboard</a>, 
    and our upcoming capabilities for Single-Sign-On and Enterprise-wide 
    Release Management of apps. Our Enterprise partners also benefit 
    from access to powerful features currently only available to our 
    internal implementation teams. Compare Enterprise directly with 
    other subscriptions <a href="{% url 'commcare_pricing' %}">here</a>.
