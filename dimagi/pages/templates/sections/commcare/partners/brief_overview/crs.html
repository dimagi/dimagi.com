            CRS uses CommCare as part of its Reducing Maternal and Newborn Deaths 
            (ReMiND) project. This work aims to improve the delivery of 
            community-level prenatal and postnatal care and support services to 
            local mothers and families. The application is used by frontline 
            health workers in India and reaches more than 300,000 people.
