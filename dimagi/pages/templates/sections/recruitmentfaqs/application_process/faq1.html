    All applicants should submit a resume. A resume in a PDF format is best suited for our 
    Applicant Tracking System. A cover letter is optional in most cases. Any other job-specific 
    submissions will be noted on the Job Description. Please do not submit any third-party 
    proprietary information or material you do not have the right to distribute.
