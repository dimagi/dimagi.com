  Once you understand the factors in your control, it is time to consider the context of where you will be deploying your
  programâ€“including what is out of your control. If you are deploying in a low or no connectivity environment, look for a
  system that includes offline functionality. Many platforms will allow you to record data on the device and upload
  when connectivity returns. Some even allow for offline case management, meaning you can store data from prior
  visits on the device to access and update even without an internet connection.
