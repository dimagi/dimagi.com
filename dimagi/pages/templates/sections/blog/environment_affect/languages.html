  What languages do your end users and beneficiaries speak?

{% block content %}{% blocktrans %}
  Sometimes your team and beneficiaries speak a range of languages. If this is the case for your program, you should
  look for a tool that allows you to easily translate a given form. Some tools go even further, allowing a user to select a
  language for their application depending on their audience. If the beneficiaries cannot read, some tools also allow for
  audio playback of the text on the screen.
