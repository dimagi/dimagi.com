  Often, programs require that workers revisit data source (beneficiaries, locations, etc)
  to collect updated information. In this case, a platform that allows you to link and review multiple data
  entries with a feature, such as case management, can be helpful. Otherwise, a paper-based program might require
  frontline workers to carry around several forms to have the full context of a patient's medical history.
