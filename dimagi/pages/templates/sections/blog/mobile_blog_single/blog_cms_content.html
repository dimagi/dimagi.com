        Mobile apps can validate data upon entry to ensure higher accuracy. They can incorporate complex mobile form features – such
        as skip logic – to help collect data more efficiently. Updates and programmatic changes can be deployed to the field without the
        need for printing and distributing new paper surveys. Frontline workers can reference counsel built into the mobile app to advise
        them through particularly challenging assessments as they speak with beneficiaries. Supervisors can securely access relevant
        data, even doing so instantly when the worker has a mobile connection.

        Depending on the issues your program faces, the switch to mobile data collection can both improve your program and even lead
        to significant cost savings. One World Bank study found that the average survey cost was reduced by 71.3% when adopting a
        mobile data collection tool over paper.

        Frontline workers have also indicated that as a result of their use of a mobile data collection app, their credibility in the
        community increased. Given these benefits, mobile data collection could be an answer for your program, and outlining your data
        requirements should be your first step to selecting the right tool.
