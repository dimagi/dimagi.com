          How Do Your Data Requirements Affect Your
          Mobile Data Collection Tool?

          Mobile data collection tools have immense potential but there isn’t a single solution that will work for everyone. As you might
          expect, different tools offer different features. Dimagi’s User Engagement Manager Marshall Daly recommends evaluating your
          data needs before you start looking at different market offerings. “Like any other data collection program, start with the data you
          want, and then find a tool that allows you to collect that data,” Daly said. Even after identifying your data requirements, selecting
          the right platform is often a challenge, and there are several points you should consider throughout the selection process:

          As always with the sharing of data, consider any privacy and security needs associated with patient information.
          Many tools offer various levels of security, so be sure to check whether your chosen platform will be compliant with all relevant
          data privacy regulations.

          Not only does the type of data you collect affect the tools and features you need to collect it, but its characteristics and those of
          its environment will also be important considerations when deciding on the right mobile data collection application for your team.
