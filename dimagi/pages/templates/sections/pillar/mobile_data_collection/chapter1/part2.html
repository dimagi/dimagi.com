        Understand your data requirements before selecting a mobile data collection tool

        Mobile data collection tools have immense potential but here isn't a single solution that will work for everyone. 
        As you might expect, different tools offer different features.

        “Like any other data collection program, start with the data you
        want, and then find a tool that allows you to collect that data.”

        Your data requirements will indicate whether you need an app that can capture GPS coordinates or video.
        Listing out your data requirements will also help you determine whether you need to track data over time,
        and determine what data access privileges you may need.

        Mobile data collection solutions range in price, some are harder to maintain than others, 
        and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. Beyond the features that deal with what data you collect,
        look at how the structure of your program or the characteristics of the region you work in might affect your platform needs.

        Considerations like the scale of your program, the digital literacy of your team, and the mobile connectivity in 
        your project region will all tell you something about how to choose (and eventually design) your mobile data collection app.

        Mobile data collection tools on their own are not silver bullets. 
        They cannot fix a poorly-designed program, and a solution designed for a basic survey will not aid your complex case management program.

        However, the right mobile data collection application will improve the accuracy and speed of your data collection, 
        help your team do its best work, and ultimately, amplify the impact of your program.
