        While it may be the standard method of data collection at many organizations, there are significant issues associated with a
        paper based data approach, such as high error rates, slow reporting, inflexibility in deployment, and difficulties in beneficiary

        With the proper implementation, each of these issues can be minimized with the use of a mobile data collection tool.
        Such mobile apps can validate data upon entry, incorporate complex mobile form features, automatically deploy updates, and
        advise frontline workers and their supervisors on the best course of action.
