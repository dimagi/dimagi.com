      This approach has been proven to increase the speed and accuracy of data collection, service delivery effectiveness, and
      program staff performance. Features of mobile data collection, such as decision support, form logic, and checklists, improve the
      quality of the data collected, while also ensuring adherence to data collection and care protocols.
