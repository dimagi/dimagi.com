        Mobile data collection is a method of compiling qualitative
        and quantitative inputs via a mobile device (e.g. mobile phone,
        tablet, etc.). Collecting data digitally has been proven to
        increase the speed and accuracy of data collection, service
        delivery effectiveness, and  program staff performance.
        Features of mobile data collection, such as decision support,
        form logic, and checklists, improve the quality of the data
        collected, while also ensuring adherence to data collection
        and care protocols.

        of understanding your program objectives, defining your
        data needs, and identifying and implementing a data collection
        solution that works for you.
