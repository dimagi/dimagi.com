        Effective adult learning involves specific techniques. Experiential learning, an understanding of a topic’s importance, and freedom to learn in
        their own way are a few methods that are helpful during  trainings. Keep in mind your participants’ backgrounds while choosing which of these 
        techniques is the best fit.

        Your workers need to know how the app will help them do their job better. Explain to them how it will help them reach more beneficiaries or 
        consult them faster. Show them results from the pilot or data from similar efforts and challenge them to beat it. You can’t expect your workers 
        to just accept the challenges that might come with the new way of working -- you have to empower them.

        Just like you know your workers’ level of digital literacy and objectives, you should know what type of learners they are: Visual, 
        auditory, or tactile. Everyone learns in a different way, so tailor your training to your workers – and sometimes that means taking a 
        hybrid approach.

         Some workers learn best by getting their hands on the app and playing with it.
