        Post-training reinforcement helps a great deal in retention of newly-learned skills and knowledge by filling any gaps that remained from 
        the initial training. Two ways we reinforce our training are:

              We conduct refresher trainings at regular intervals to cover both the things that our workers have forgotten and our new workers. 
              It also provides a good opportunity to notify workers of new features or for workers to share advice and feedback.

              We develop support mechanisms to guide workers as they use the application in real time. Whether itâ€™s a one-pager, comprehensive 
              user manual, or in-app training module, the idea is to provide your team with the tools they need to troubleshoot any issues on their own. 
              For more advice on how to compile a training guide for your app, check out our guide.

        Give yourself and your team the best shot at successfully launching your mobile data collection program by arming them with the tools and 
        training they need. Tailor your approach to their needs, just like you did with the app, and they will be better for it.
