        Plan for development
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h2>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        You are almost there! Before you dive into the creation of
        the app itself, outline your approach to understand when
        you will include which features, and what development
        methodology your team will use.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Often, teams forget to establish these items before
        getting started, including knowing how to approach the
        build phase, communicating with their team, and defining
        timelines. Avoid setbacks by establishing a clear process
        and guidelines around the app build.

    <h3>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Make your versioning plan
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        The first thing you should realize in the build phase is
        that not everything will always fit in the first version
        of your app.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Think carefully about what is time sensitive or a priority
        as well as the level of effort associated with including
        certain criteria. You need to map out a versioning plan
        to identify what modules and features will be included
        in each version of your app.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        However, versioning plans should not just be focused on what is
        possible to include in any particular version. Also, consider
        which features or flows make the best introduction to the tool
        for new users and which might be too confusing for them to
        take on from the start.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Sometimes it makes sense to introduce a certain feature set
        that you know the user will be able to understand quickly and
        wait until they are comfortable before introducing new
        functionality. For instance, if your users have never had a
        mobile device before, it might make sense to start with
        text-only inputs and withhold functionality like image
        capture until they become more familiar with the basic
        functionality of the device.

    <h3>

        Decide on an app development methodology
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        The next step is about determining how you will build
        your app. Keep your team organized and focused on their
        assigned workstreams. One app development methodology
        that we found can help with this is Agile (also known
        as Scrum). Agileâ€™s principles of incremental development
        and constant iteration help ensure you are staying
        focused on your project priorities, and validating
        along the way. JIRA is a software project management
        software built to support agile teams and processes.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Whatever methodology you choose, make sure roles,
        responsibilities, and processes are very clear to the
        team, and that everyone agrees. Then establish
        mechanisms to ensure your team sticks to them.
