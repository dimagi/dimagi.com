        While paper might be the standard for collecting data at many
        organizations, there are significant issues associated with a
        paper-based data collection system. The most prominent
        challenges include:

        Depending on the issues you face, the switch to a
        mobile platform can clearly improve your program and even
        lead to significant cost savings. One World Bank study
        found that the average survey cost was reduced by 71.3%
        when adopting a mobile data collection solution over paper.
        Frontline workers have also indicated that as a result of their
        use of a mobile data collection tool, their credibility in the
        community increased. Given these benefits, mobile data collection
        might be an answer for your program. Before you start evaluating
        potential solutions, you should first outline your data
        requirements, which will help you select the right tool.
