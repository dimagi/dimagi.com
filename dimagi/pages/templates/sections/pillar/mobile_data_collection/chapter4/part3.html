         Pilots are the time and place where we get our technology right and ensure we are developing something useful for the user. 
         They are when we establish and test processes that are required for the long&mdash;term success of a program. 
         The tension is that pilots are meant to be both a special, focused program effort that may differ from the final program, 
         as well as a process to get us ready to scale and succeed in that same final program.

        Pilots help test the app itself and the new processes you introduce along with it, and they're useful both at the beginning of a 
        program and at any point during it to make sure things continue running the way you intend.

        Testing is a key way to ensure that after selecting atool, designing the structure of your app, and building aprototype, 
        you have still placed the end users and beneficiaries at the center of the process. Check your assumptions against reality to see 
        whether the solutions you have developed will have the impact you hope for.
