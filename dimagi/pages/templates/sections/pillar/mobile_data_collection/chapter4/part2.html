        How Do Your Data Requirements Affect Your
        Mobile Data Collection Tool?

        Mobile data collection tools have immense potential but there isn't
        a single solution that will work for everyone. As you might expect,
        different tools offer different features.

        Dimagi's User Engagement Manager Marshall Daly recommends
        evaluating your data needs before you start looking at
        different market offerings.

        "Like any other data collection program, start with the data you
        want, and then find a tool that allows you to collect that
        data," Daly said.

        platform is often a challenge, and there are several points
        you should consider throughout the selection process:

            If your program requires that workers
            revisit data sources (beneficiaries, locations, etc.)
            to collect updated information, your platform should
            allow you to link and review multiple data entries with
            a feature such as case management.

        Not only does the type of data you collect affect the tools
        and features you need to collect it, but its characteristics
        and those of its environment will also be important
        considerations when deciding on the right mobile data
        collection solution for your team.
