        It can be tempting to conclude that a mobile data collection tool
        will solve all the problems you currently face with your data
        collection program. Except first, you have to know what that
        program looks like, what its strengths and weaknesses are,
        and how the information flows in the field.

        This process will reveal things about where your data comes from,
        who has access to it, and how it is collected and stored &mdash; all
        key pieces of information that will inform the design and
        implementation of any new system you choose. Most mobile
        data collection tools will claim to speed up the process
        and make it more efficient, and that's probably true &mdash;
        but only when you know which parts of your current process
        could benefit from those improvements the most.

        When you have to map out your project from square one,
        it opens your eyes to gaps you didn't see earlier and
        that technology may not be able to fix. All of a sudden,
        the conversation may shift from 'What do we want this
        technology to do' to 'Wait, actually, is the problem
        in our workflow?'

        An information flow diagram is most often what we use
        when mapping how information flows through an existing
        data collection process. It typically starts with what
        data is being collected (e.g. quantitative data vs
        qualitative data) and follows through from how it is
        collected (e.g. paper forms vs mobile device) to where
        it is stored and how it is shared from the bottom to the
        top of your organization (e.g. reporting presentation vs
        online dashboard).

      This is the most basic version of an information flow diagram.

        Data from beneficiaries is collected by community health
        workers (or other data collectors) using a mobile data
        collection tool that wirelessly sends data to the cloud.
        There, it is accessed by a program manager or analyst on a
        desktop platform.

        Of course, this version doesn't include what type of data
        it is or how that program analyst shares reports with their
        superiors, funders, or the government. However, that
        is exactly the type of information that is covered in
        more complex information flow diagrams.

        Two key questions to ask when designing your information
        flow diagram are (1) What are the major activities or
        milestones that occur in this process? And (2) What
        are the major component types (e.g. actions/activities,
        documents, decisions, etc.)? The answers to these
        questions are like the pieces to your puzzle. Once
        you collect them all, start with the outside and
        work your way in. In other words, begin with your
        data source and your final output and then fill out
        the pieces in-between.
