        A clear view of the entire process, including both program
        and worker performance metrics, is crucial for your supervisors
        keep the program running. With paper forms, most of their time
        would be spent on tracking down data and following up with
        users. Now that they have a mobile data collection program,
        this information should already be at their fingertips,
        allowing them to focus their efforts on supporting the
        workers who need the most help.

        Supervisors should review broadstroke details of the work
        that the end users are doing, including the number of forms
        submitted per user per day, to help measure activity on the
        application.
