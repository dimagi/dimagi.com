        Your app might be built and the first version tested, but before you can press "deploy," there are few final pieces to iron out. 
        You need to know what devices your app will run on and the network they'll use to transmit data. Your workers need to know what they can use the
        devices for and how to refill their data when they run out. Cover off on these final preparations to make sure the mobile data collection app that you have worked so hard on actually works on a mobile device.
