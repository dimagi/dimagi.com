        Develop phone usage policies

    <p>

         Don't skip this step. Phone usage policies are crucial, and we recommend them for all of our projects. 
         These policies determine device handling, including what should be done in case of lost or broken devices and theft, or which 
         apps the user is allowed to install.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Precisely what these policies cover will depend on the nature of the project, but they will help in setting expectations with your users to 
        avoid confusion and disputes when an incident does occur.

        Once your devices are ready for action, it's time to introduce them to your team.
