        Certain sectors lean more heavily on this consideration than
        others. For some beneficiary populations and projects, such as those
        working with HIV patient data, privacy concerns may be much more
        important than others. You might find a few relevant answers as part
        of your evaluation of your existing data collection program, but
        understanding where the data you collect goes is vitally important.

        The actual considerations will depend on the sector you are working
        in. For instance, projects in the public health domain might require
        you to consider patient confidentiality and HIPAA compliance. The
        FDA has shared guidelines for the use of electronic health record
        data that may be helpful for your project.

        As you consider the storage and privacy of your data,
        ask yourself the following:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <ul class="check-list grid grid-row-space-base pad-bottom-base">
      <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
          Does the dataset need to be de-identified before
          exporting and sharing?
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
          Do I need to protect certain data after it
          is entered?
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
          Who can have access to the data?
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {% blocktrans %}
          How long can the data be stored?
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        All of these considerations will be specific to the industry or
        sector that you work in, while others will depend on local
        laws or even partner organizationsâ€™ codes of conduct. Make sure
        you are familiar with the requirements of all parties involved
        before you begin collecting data.
