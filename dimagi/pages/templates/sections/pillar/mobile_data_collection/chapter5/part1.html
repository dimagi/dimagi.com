        What is content design?
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h2>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Content design is about developing a survey or assessment that
        generates responses to best inform the goals of your project.
        This involves setting up clear questions that avoid bias,
        maintain consistency in phrasing, and are culturally appropriate.

        Spending a bit of time
        <a href="https://dimagi.com/blog/mobile-data-collection-app-design-tips-stc"
           target="_blank">planning and strategically designing
        the content</a> (e.g. questions, surveys, etc.) that will be used
        in your project will help ensure that you follow a systematic
        process collecting data from your target beneficiaries, from
        the beginning to the end of the data collection period. It
        is not just about putting all the questions you can think of in
        the survey.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        With a consistent, well-thought-out design, results that emerge
        from data collection will be cleaner and more easily compared
        with results collected at a different time point or even by
        other programs and projects with similar objectives.

        Avoiding bias in phrasing and questions

    </h4>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        To capture the full range of possible answers, the phrasing of
        your questions should remain neutral, which can be easier said
        than done. Depending on the topic, it can require extensive
        knowledge of the subject, including public perception, power
        dynamics, and even general controversies within the field.

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Another area to pay close attention to is the phrasing of
        questions that are intended to elicit more subjective
        responses (i.e. opinions, feelings, or beliefs). The way you
        pose the question can influence beneficiaries' responses in
        ways that may be unintended.

      {% blocktrans %}
        Addressing cultural expectations
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Cultural references and word selection in survey questions
        may lead to variability in interpretations of the questions
        when applied to different populations.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        A common example that would increase the accuracy of your data
        collection would be if your project targeted beneficiaries in
        rural Tanzania, you may consider including a multiple choice question
        inquiring about the beneficiariesâ€™ languages spoken at home.
        The choices could include Kiswahili, English, and potentially
        other dialects based on prior knowledge of the population
        you are working with.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Considerations like these should be balanced with the overall
        goal of the program, as a culturally-specific reference may
        help get a reliable answer for one beneficiary, but if the
        sample is ever expanded, then you may run into issues.

        Using validated surveys
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Why recreate a survey instrument when there may be one that
        already exists that is well-aligned with your project objectives?
        There are databases of existing, validated surveys that would
        allow you to reliably assess and compare your results with
        those of other projects in the broader community. For
        example, RAND Health provides free online access to their
        surveys covering a variety of health topics.
