        Managing Your Devices

        In one of our national projects in India, we realized the
        importance of device management as soon as we began scaling.
        Indeed, some states required 45,000 devices be made ready
        for use within a matter of days.

        To achieve this feat, we had to consider a few key things:

    <h3>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Choosing the Right Device
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Your app should not only function on the device &mdash;
        it should thrive.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Problems like slowness and app crashes should already be
        addressed during design and testing. However, while
        smaller projects might be able to design for a
        specific model, apps for larger scale may need
        to work for a wider range of device specifications.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Over the years, we have tested CommCare across a
        range of Android devices and summarized our
        experience with each. The more complex and customized
        your application, the more important it is that you
        perform these tests with your own app to make sure you
        find the right device(s) for your program.
