    <h2>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Managing Your Devices
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h2>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        In one of our national projects in India, we realized the
        importance of device management as soon as we began scaling.
        Indeed, some states required 45,000 devices be made ready
        for use within a matter of days.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        To achieve this feat, we had to consider a few key things:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Choosing the Right Device
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Your app should not only function on the device &mdash;
        it should thrive.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Problems like slowness and app crashes should already be
        addressed during design and testing. However, while
        smaller projects might be able to design for a
        specific model, apps for larger scale may need
        to work for a wider range of device specifications.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Over the years, we have tested CommCare across a
        range of Android devices and summarized our
        experience with each. The more complex and customized
        your application, the more important it is that you
        perform these tests with your own app to make sure you
        find the right device(s) for your program.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Device Preparation
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        As the number of users increases, the complexity of
        device preparation increases exponentially.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Smaller projects might not have as much trouble
        preparing their devices for the field, but preparing
        a device for field use is still a tedious job.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        When a new device is opened, it takes a few minutes
        for the initial setup. Often, there is a mandatory
        operating system update, which adds a few more minutes.
        Once the device is ready, the data collection app
        needs to be installed.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        For projects with only a few users, this is not too
        much of an issue. However, for projects with hundreds
        (or thousands) of users, this process can take
        weeks, with each device requiring up to 45 minutes
        for complete setup.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        To avoid last-minute scrambling, large programs should
        identify a specific person to lead the activity who is
        accountable for delivering prepared devices to the
        training / rollout team.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h3>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Phone Usage Policies
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h3>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Don't skip this step. Phone usage policies are crucial,
        and we recommend them for all of our projects. These
        policies determine device handling, including what should
        be done in case of lost or broken devices and theft.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        They might also cover how much mobile data the device
        will have or what apps users are allowed to install.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Precisely what these policies cover will depend on the
        nature of the project, but they will help in setting
        expectations with your users to avoid confusion and
        disputes when an incident does occur.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        Once your devices are ready for action, it's time to
        introduce them to your team.
      {% endblocktrans %}
