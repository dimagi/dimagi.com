        Weâ€™ll be straight with you: Actually launching your program
        can be the hardest part. In fact, 70% of the World Bank's
        information and communications technologies for
        development (ICT4D) programs have failed. And finding
        out why can be a tricky test. Fortunately, we have
        the experience of over 500 projects to help
        inform the answer.

        For one, digital literacy is often low among the
        frontline workers where mobile data collection
        tools are introduced.

        Another reason is that the interpretation of
        technology varies from person to person and depends
        on the context: The way an experienced ICT program
        manager sees a particular data collection app
        is likely different from how the community
        health worker will approach the solution.

        Use the information you have about your audience and
        environment to transform your new tool into a successful
        program. Realize it is not the app that will solve all
        your problems: It is the people who use it who
        matter most.
