        Once you have listed, organized, and described all the variables
        you need to collect, you still need to account for where you are

        all the variables you need will help keep you focused.
        It won't surprise you to know that data is the most
        important piece of any mobile data collection program,
        so a comprehensive understanding of the data you need to
        collect is vital.
