      {% blocktrans %}
        Most often in mobile data collection and service delivery programs,
        your data can be broken down into two categories:

    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        (1) <strong>Program performance metrics</strong> tell you how well
        you are meeting your project objectives. They help answer questions
        like, "How many beneficiaries have you reached?" and "What
        percentage of your beneficiaries have improved health outcomes or
        crop yield?"
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        (2) <strong>Worker Performance Metrics</strong> are the best
        indicators for how well your workers are performing their duties
        and how much they are contributing to the success of the project.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
        These categories help explain which aspect of your program the
        data affects.
