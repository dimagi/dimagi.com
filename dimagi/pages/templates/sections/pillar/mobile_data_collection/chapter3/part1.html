        Keep your team organized and focused on their assigned workstreams. One app development methodology that we found can
        help with this is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2016/09/08/explaining-agile/#5c78ebe7301b" target="_blank"><u>Agile</u></a> (also known as Scrum), whose principles of incremental development and constant iteration help ensure
        you are staying focused on your project priorities, and validating along the way.

        <a herf="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank"><u>JIRA</u></a> is a software project management software built to support agile teams and processes.
        Whatever methodology you choose, make sure roles, responsibilities, and processes are very clear to the team, and that
        everyone agrees. Then, establish mechanisms to ensure your team sticks to them.
