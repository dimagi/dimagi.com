        A clear view of the entire process, including both program and worker performance metrics, is crucial for your supervisors to keep 
        the program running.

         The <a href="https://dimagi.com/blog/mobile-data-collection-worker-performance/" target="_blank"><u>metrics used to monitor worker performance</u></a> should be designed as per the nature of the project and agreed upon between workers and supervisors prior to implementation. 
         The right metrics will be easy to track and help incentivize users to improve their own performance.

         With paper forms, most of their time would be spent on tracking down data and following up with users.

         efforts on supporting the workers who need the most help.
