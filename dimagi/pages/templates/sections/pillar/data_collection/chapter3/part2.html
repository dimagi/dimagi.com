      Once you have listed, organized, and described all the variables you need to collect, you still need to account for where you are collecting data and who you are collecting it from. What are the languages spoken by the people involved (both data collectors and beneficiaries)? What is the reading level or digital literacy level of your typical field worker? How is mobile connectivity in the region?

      Each of the answers to these questions means something different for how you will need to set up your program – different languages mean translating forms, low or no internet connection means using a tool that works offline. We recommend <a href="https://nextbillion.net/how-designing-under-the-mango-tree-can-prevent-digital-solution-hiccups/" target="_blank"><u>collaborating with the local workers</u></a> to overcome any challenges you face. It’s unlikely that this is the first time they are dealing with them.

      Certain sectors lean more heavily on this consideration than others. For some beneficiary populations and projects such as those working with HIV patient data, privacy concerns may be much more important than others. Thus, understanding where the data you collect go is vitally important.

      The actual considerations will depend on the sector you are working in. For instance, projects in the public health domain might require you to consider patient confidentiality and HIPAA compliance. The FDA has shared guidelines for the use of electronic health record data that may be helpful for your project, including whether you need to de-identify data or restrict access to it after collection. Make sure you are familiar with the requirements of all parties involved before you decide how to collect your data.
