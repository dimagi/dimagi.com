       As you can see, the method of data collection that is right for your program is entirely dependent upon your program objectives
       and data requirements. Some programs might even call for a combination or hybrid of approaches to collect all the information you need.

        As you evaluate your options, always make sure that their strengths map back to the objectives of your program and account for the
        characteristics of your sources. Once you make your choice, itâ€™s time to put all the pieces together.
