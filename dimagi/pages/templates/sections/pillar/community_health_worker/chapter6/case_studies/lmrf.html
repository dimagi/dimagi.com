          In 2013, Lata Medical Research Foundation (LMRF) partnered with Dimagi
          to assess CommCareâ€™s feasibility for monitoring antenatal, natal, and
          post-natal care, as well as infant nutrition, in rural India. LMRF
          adopted CommCare to help accredited social health activists (ASHAs)
          track pregnant women and familiarize them and their families with
          available public health programs focused on improving health-seeking
          behavior and maternal & child health outcomes. At the start, ten ASHAs
          were responsible for collecting data from a total of 80 pregnant women
          starting from their third trimester until six months after delivery.
