        Community health workers are often selected by their community and end
        up being disproportionately female – more than 70%. Many countries also
        establish requirements for their community health worker candidates.
        For instance, to help support their maternal and child health initiatives,
        the Mozambique Ministry of Health has been giving preference to female
        candidates while requiring a minimum of a seventh-grade education.

        The same recommendations also instruct programs not to select community health
        workers based on either age or marital status. According to an analysis by USAID,
