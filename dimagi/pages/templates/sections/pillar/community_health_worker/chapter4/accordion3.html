              Findings suggest that individualized asthma education provided by a trained,
              culturally competent CHW is effective in improving asthma management
              among poorly controlled, inner-city children.

            A study by the Sinai Urban Health Institute showed that “symptom
            frequency was reduced by 35% and urgent health resource utilization
            by 75%” when a community health worker program began in Chicago, a
            city with twice the national rate of asthma. In this program, CHWs
            were responsible for providing individualized health education and,
            as appropriate, serving as links between the affected families and
            the health system. The study also showed the intervention to be
            cost-effective, saving an estimated $5.58 per dollar spent.
