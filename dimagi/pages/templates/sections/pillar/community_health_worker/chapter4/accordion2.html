              Interventions by CHWs appear to be effective when compared with
              alternatives and also cost-effective for certain health
              conditions, particularly when partnering with low-income,
              underserved, and racial and ethnic minority communities.

            A review supported by the National Institute of Health covered
            hundreds of individual studies, finding CHWs were most often
            responsible for health education, counseling, health system
            navigation assistance, and other social support. Interestingly,
            training times ranged widely, from as little as four hours to as
            much as 240, averaging just over 40 hours, while supervision was
            typically either weekly or monthly. According to eight articles
            on cost analysis, integrating community health workers into the
            health system “was associated with cost-effective and sustainable care.”
