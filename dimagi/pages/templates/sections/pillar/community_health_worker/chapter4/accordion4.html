              After interaction with a CHW, primary and specialty care visits
              increased and urgent care, inpatient, and outpatient behavioral
              health care utilization decreased, resulting in a reduction of
              monthly uncompensated costs by $14,244.

            A study published in the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and
            Underserved reviewed the potential cost savings and return on
            investment from implementing community health worker interventions.
            The study explains that CHW programs “are effective in improving
            access to health care, promoting client knowledge and behavior
            change, and contributing to improved health status of individuals,”
            but that few studies have also appreciated the potential return on
            investment of more than 2-to-1 that programs can achieve by using the model.
