      A literature review by RTI International found that a community health
      worker model will improve health outcomes for underserved or
      low-resource communities depending on the health conditions they face.
      For instance, CHW interventions were found to have the greatest effect
      compared to alternatives when used for disease prevention, asthma
      management, cervical cancer screening, and mammography screening outcomes.
