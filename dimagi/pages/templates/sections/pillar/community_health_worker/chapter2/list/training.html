{% block description %}{% blocktrans %}
  To improve the quality and speed of care, CHWs need to be well-trained in both
  the medical and administrative sides of the job. Unfortunately, whether
  itâ€™s due to low levels of literacy or education, poor training materials,
  or inconsistent refresher trainings, CHWs are often not well-enough equipped
  to reach their potential.
