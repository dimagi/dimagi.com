          This digital health maturity model helps governments and other community
          health implementers grow effective digital health programs for the
          community level. The model evaluates three domains: (1) community health
          programs, (2) policy, funding, & technical infrastructure, and (3) existing
          health technologies, which positions health systems on a maturity level
          based on a 5-staged continuum scale. Along with a toolkit, the model helps
          programs indentify areas of prioirity that inform strategy development,
          investement cases, and a structured pathway to implementing a scalable
          sustainable digital health program for community health.
