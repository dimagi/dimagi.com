        A study from a group of researchers at Johns Hopkins reviewed the
        use of mHealth tools to support frontline health workers on more than
        140 projects around the world. We are particularly fond of this
        report, as it points out that CommCare is the application of choice
        for the majority of these projects, most of which were based in Africa
        (91 in total). Review this report to learn about how the mHealth tools
        were organized under 12 different functions, including
        <a href="{% url 'data_collection' %}" target="_blank" class="orange-dark">
        data collection</a>, electronic decision support, and client education
        and behavior change communication.
