          A study from a group of researchers at Johns Hopkins reviewed the
          use of mHealth tools to support frontline health workers on more than
          140 projects around the world. We are particularly fond of this
          report, as it points out that CommCare is the application of choice
          for the majority of these projects, most of which were based in Africa
          (91 in total). Review this report to learn about how the mHealth tools
          were organized under 12 different functions, including data collection,
          electronic decision support, and client education and behavior change communication.
