    On a daily basis as a CHW I go to my households which [I] am allocated
    and I pass not only on health matters. For those mothers who have school
    going children I also advise them to take their children to school. Also
    as a CHW I see to it that my structures are clean so that the environment
    is comfortable for everyone. Sometimes maybe once or twice in a month I
    organise a cleanup, so we clean the area surrounding my structures with
    the community not alone.
