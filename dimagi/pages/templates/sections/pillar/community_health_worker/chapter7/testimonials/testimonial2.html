          I teach and help them construct dish racks and leaky tins, I show them
          the importance of mosquito nets so that they don't fall sick as they
          spend a lot of money in the hospitals. I also emphasis on hygiene and
          sanitation in the household and we make refuse pits and specific ones
          for disposal of sharpsâ€¦ Now I am happy that I have taught them and
          they are uplifting their health status.
