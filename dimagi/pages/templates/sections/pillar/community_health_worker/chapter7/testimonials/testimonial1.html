          The relationship between me and the facility is that I bring patients
          from the households to the facility. If there is an expectant mother
          or a mother who has had a home delivery I send them to the facility
          as quickly as possible and if it is a sick person I refer. We have a
          very good relationship which must be there. I am a link between
          the community and facility.
