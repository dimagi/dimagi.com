            A literature review of 25 studies on the use of mobile technology for
            community health worker programs found the prevalence and effectiveness
            of mHealth technology to be growing around the world: “Small-scale
            efforts, pilot projects, and preliminary descriptive studies are
            increasing, and there is a trend toward using feasible and acceptable
            interventions that lead to positive program outcomes through operational
            improvements and rigorous study designs.” The studies also reviewed the
            different uses of technology for CHW programs, as well as the various
            sectors that use them. Uses include data collection, notifications,
            education, two-way communications, and protocol adherence, while the broad
            range of health sectors highlighted maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS,
            and sexual and reproductive health. Studies that reviewed the effectiveness
            of mobile-enabled community health workers saw these tools “improve the
            quality of care provided, efficiency of services, and capacity for program monitoring.”

            A review of information from peer-reviewed journals, websites, and key
            reports found that “with partnerships forming between governments,
            technologists, non-governmental organizations, academia, and industry,
            there is great potential to improve health services delivery by using
            mHealth in low- and middle-income countries.” In this review, the mobile
            tools’ most common uses were to support CHWs with notifications,
            job aides, decision support, data collection features, and instant
            feedback. This report also includes some discussion of the need to scale
            the community health worker pilots into full, national-scale programs.

            A study from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute reviewed
            community health workers’ reactions to the support and usability of
            a mobile tool for health education and protocol compliance. According
            to their interviews, users were highly satisfied, as the application
            helped improve their level of knowledge and ability to manage
            patients. They also reported a “positive change in health facility
            organization” and decision-making, using the application as a learning
            tool to improve their ability to provide primary care in Burkina Faso.

            A study carried out by researchers from UC Berkeley examined how mobile
            tools helped community health workers overcome challenges associated
            with their limited education, training, and status, as well as resistance
            to change in the village. In the end, the mobile-based job aide increased
            the motivation and performance of the workers, while also giving leaders
            in the community a reason to promote the work of the CHWs.

            A study published in BioMed Central evaluated the cost effectiveness of
            Catholic Relief Service’s Reducing Maternal and Newborn Deaths (ReMiND)
            program by looking at the incremental cost per disability adjusted life
            year (DALY) averted as a result of the intervention as compared to
            routine maternal and child health programs without ReMiND. In summarizing
            their findings, the study explains that if the program were scaled
            state-wide, it could save 312 maternal and 149,468 neonatal lives. They also
            found the program to be “a cost saving intervention from societal perspective,”
            saving a projected $2,569 for every death averted.
