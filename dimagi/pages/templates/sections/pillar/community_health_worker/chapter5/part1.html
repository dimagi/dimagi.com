        A key recommendation in the World Health Organization’s guidelines
        for community health worker programs highlights the value that mobile
        devices can provide. These tools can improve workers’ performance, as
        well as the health-seeking behaviors and health outcomes of their
        clients. There are many studies that have looked at the effect of these
        mobile tools, including series of randomized control trials that have
        found a 46% increase in protocol adherence, a 60-75% increase in
        facility-based deliveries, and a 75% decrease in training times.
