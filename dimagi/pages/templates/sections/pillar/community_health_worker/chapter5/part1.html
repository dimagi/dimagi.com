        A key recommendation in the World Health Organization’s guidelines
        for community health worker programs highlights the value that mobile
        devices can provide. These tools can improve <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/blog/mobile-data-collection-worker-performance/" target="_blank">
        workers’ performance,</a> as well as the health-seeking behaviors and health outcomes of their
        clients. There are many studies that have looked at the effect of these
        mobile tools, including series of <a href="https://www.dimagi.com/toolkits/commcare-evidence-base/" target="_blank">
        randomized control trials</a> that have found a 46% increase in protocol
        adherence, a 60-75% increase in facility-based deliveries, and a 75%
        decrease in training times.
