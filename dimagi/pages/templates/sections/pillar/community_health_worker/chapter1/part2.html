        The World Health Organization also recently shared a career ladder for a 
        community health worker to show how their role can change within the health 
        system over time â€“ from volunteer responsible for offering health information 
        and capturing data to trained (and paid) community health workers able to 
        provide care and diagnose patients. Larger programs may also employ supervisory 
        roles that are often filled by former community health workers.
