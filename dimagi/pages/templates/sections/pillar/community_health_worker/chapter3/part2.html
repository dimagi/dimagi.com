            Ethiopia, one of the countries analyzed by USAID, is an unlikely
            success story. In one of the poorest countries in the world, the
            Ministry of Health has hired and trained 40,000 community health
            workers to provide essential health services around the country,
            combating child mortality, HIV, malaria, and TB. Since 1990, child
            mortality has decreased by 70%, HIV infections by 90%, malaria deaths
            by 75% and TB deaths by 64%.

            While smaller, non-governmental organizations have been implementing the
            community health worker model on a local level with documented success,
            Ethiopia stands as an example of how even the most underfunded ministries
            of health can help improve health outcomes at a national level.
