        In February 2019, USAID released a landscape analysis of 22 countries
        that employ a national-scale community health worker model. Overall, 53
        CHW cadres were observed, averaging 2-3 per country, which shows how
        different initiatives require CHWs to perform different roles.

        According to the analysis, all 22 countries employed at least one cadre
        that received both financial and nonfinancial incentives. The most
        common financial incentives were “per diems... followed by salary, cash
        payments, and performance-based payments.”

        However, all 22 countries also benefited from the services of volunteer
        CHWs who receive nonfinancial incentives, such as frequent supervision,
        continuous training, and clear roles and communication channels for
        CHWs within health systems.
