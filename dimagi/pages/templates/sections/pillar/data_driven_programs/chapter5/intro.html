        The best part about everything we’ve just covered is not that it all 
        comes from data you already collect and processes you already 
        follow—it’s that it can actually make your program better.

        <strong>Step 1)</strong> Review the data practices you already follow

        <strong>Step 2)</strong> Set up automated reports and regular reviews with your team

      {% blocktrans %}
        <strong>Step 3)</strong> Look at the services you already offer and 
        find the levers you might need to pull in different circumstances.

        And remember: Those circumstances are always changing, so the 
        assumptions you made when you first decided what metrics to 
        track or established your data-action triggers may no longer hold.

        Try to review your plans and processes regularly (quarterly? 
        semi-annually?) to make sure that you’re able to maximize the 
        effectiveness of your program. After the onset of a global 
        pandemic, we have to realize that it’s not necessarily about 
        planning for every eventuality as much as it’s about fostering 
        a sense of vigilance and flexibility for anything that comes your way.
