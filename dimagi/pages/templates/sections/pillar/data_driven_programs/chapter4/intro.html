        In 2016, MiracleFeet reached out to Dimagi to set up the Clubfoot 
        Administration System (CAST), a universal tool to track treatment 
        and program data for their clinics around the world. Their goal 
        is to reach and treat at least 70% of children born with clubfoot, 
        a common birth defect historically overlooked in many countries 
        that is relatively cost-effective and easy to treat.

        The information that their clinics collect with the application 
        feeds into a global dashboard, where administrators around the 
        world can review treatment quality indicators for every clinic 
        in every country in real time.

        By late 2019, more than 300 clinics in 29 countries were using 
        CAST to reach patients and track their treatment. So, when the 
        COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, they already had a system 
        in place that allowed them to see which clinics were slowing 
        or shutting down treatment.

        But what could they do with this information?
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

      {% blocktrans %}
        Well, having detailed information about clinics in Tanzania 
        showed them that most were not shutting down and would need 
        PPE for clinic staff and families. In Guatemala on the other 
        hand, clinics were completely closed, and data showed that 
        many families were facing dangerous food insecurity, so the 
        program reallocated funds to provide food and supplies to the 
        most vulnerable patient families. Meanwhile, the SMS functionality 
        of the CAST app, normally focused on appointment notifications, 
        was retooled to share stretching exercises with the families of 
        patients that they could do at home while they waited for 
        clinics to reopen.

        MiracleFeet found out that one in five of their patients has had 
        their treatment delayed due to the pandemic, so instead of 
        standing still waiting for it to pass, they acted on the data 
        they have available.

          After interaction with a CHW, primary and specialty care visits
          increased and urgent care, inpatient, and outpatient behavioral
          health care utilization decreased, resulting in a reduction of
          monthly uncompensated costs by $14,244.
