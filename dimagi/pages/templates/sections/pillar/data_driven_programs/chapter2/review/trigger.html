        Actually acting on what your reports tell you becomes much easier if you take 
        the time to plan ahead. Set ranges for what “normal” data looks like and agree 
        ahead of time on what actions should be triggered when normal thresholds are crossed.

        When discussing the potential actions, you first need to know what you 
        can and cannot change in your program, keeping in mind both the scope 
        and scale of any potential actions:

            you release a new version of the app, if needed?

            How is your project set up to contact frontline workers and

            How flexible is the budget? Do you have extra funds you

        Once you establish these data-action triggers, the whole 
        process becomes much simpler: Just check your automated 
        reports every day, ready to take action. And be flexible! 
        You can always change the parameters or actions themselves.
