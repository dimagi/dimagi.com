        What you’ll notice about these three data practices is that they actually use the 
        exact same data the high-level, aggregate reports do—they just break it down a 
        bit more and more often.

        These types of reports and readouts, if viewed regularly and incorporated 
        into a regular planning and optimization process, can help you to identify 
        opportunities for immediate course corrections that you otherwise would have missed.
