  4. Donor Reporting

{% block description %}{% blocktrans %}
  <p>
    In exchange for the funds and resources they offer, donors seek transparency 
    and accountability for how these resources are used. Many donors demand detailed 
    programmatic reports on the activities their funding supports. These reports 
    often include metrics like “total beneficiaries reached,” which can paint a 
    large, heartwarming picture for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are what some might call “vanity metrics.” The total number of people 
    you reached might give you some sense of the overall program, but it can’t 
    help you understand exactly what you’ve done well (or poorly) or how you 
    can do it better. But if you start to break the number down into smaller 
    pieces and segment it—by village, by age, or by gender—that’s when you 
    start seeing a clearer picture of a program’s true impact.
