  <p>
    Endline & outcome reporting may be the least helpful indicator for program 
    improvement, because it comes after the program has finished. These reports 
    can be extremely useful in measuring the impact your program had, but won’t 
    offer much in terms of affecting that impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, sometimes our partners have received additional funding to restart 
    their programs after an initial grant ran out. In these cases, endline reports 
    can be vital to the success of that program’s second run, ensuring that new 
    funds are both secured and used optimally.
