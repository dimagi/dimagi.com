        Once things are moving along nicely, it’s time to make them even better. 
        Unfortunately, nearly 50% of organizations 
        <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/The%20age%20of%20analytics%20Competing%20in%20a%20data%20driven%20world/MGI-The-Age-of-Analytics-Full-report.pdf"
           target="_blank">avoid or delay making updates</a>
        to their applications, because they think “designing an 
        appropriate organizational structure to support data and analytics 
        activities” is too big of an obstacle.

        We hope to open your eyes to a fact that they can’t see: You’ve actually already done it.

        Inside the data you’ve already collected are hidden insights that can 
        improve your program – and maybe even save it.

      In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of evaluating your 
      current data practices, whether that’s donor reports, 
      <a href="{% url 'blog_post' 'data-collection-baseline-endline-surveys' %}"
         target="_blank">baseline & endline reports</a>, or just monthly report outs to your team. Then, we’ll show you 
      how to quickly create more regular reports of that same data. By reviewing 
      these metrics more regularly, you’ll be able to spot potential areas 
      that can improve not only your application but your program 
      overall – whether it’s related to the resources you have, the workforce 
      you support, or how you make your services available to the communities you serve.

        This is an iterative process that will continue for the duration of your 
        program. And if you’re anything like us, there will be things you spot 
        the first time through that will make you want to go right back and do 
        it again to make your program even better.
