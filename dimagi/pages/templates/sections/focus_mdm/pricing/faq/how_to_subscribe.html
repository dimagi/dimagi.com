{% endblocktrans %}{% endblock %}

{% block answer %}{% blocktrans %}
  Log into CommCareHQ and go to the project space you want to subscribe
  to a paid software plan. Click the settings wheel at the top right of
  the page, then click "Current Subscription.‚Äù Click the blue
  "Change Plan" button and select and confirm your plan. Your project
  will be subscribed to that plan immediately, and you will receive an
  invoice at the end of the month (pro-rated from the time you were
  subscribed on that plan during that month).
