{% block answer %}{% blocktrans %}
  Please note that your invoice will be sent to your billing contact.
  To make sure the billing contact information is accurate, visit your
  Project Settings > Billing Information page. If there is not a billing
  contact listed, invoices will by default be sent to the web admin users
  on the project.
