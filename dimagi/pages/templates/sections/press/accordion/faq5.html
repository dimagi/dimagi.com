      SureAdhere is Dimagi's digital adherence platform. SureAdhere is a secure mobile and 
      web-based system which includes both a patient-facing mobile application that patients 
      use to record and upload daily asynchronous videos on medication ingestion and/or treatment 
      adherence, and a provider-facing, cloud-hosted, HIPAA and GDPR-compliant web application 
      where public health staff can view asynchronous videos, document dosing histories and 
      medication adherence and other observations.
