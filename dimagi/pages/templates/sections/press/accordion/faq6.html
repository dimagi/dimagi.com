      COVID-19 has emerged as one of the worst global pandemics in the last
      century. Health systems have quickly shifted resources to mitigate its
      toll. It is clear that the effective use of digital technology will play
      a core role in how effective this COVID-19 response will be.

    To support response efforts as governments around the world look to relax
    social distancing guidelines, Dimagi is developing
    <a href="{% url 'blog_post' 'covid-19-response-template-apps'%}"
       target="_blank">configurable applications for COVID-19</a>
    using CommCare. These applications are built for frontline workers and
    designed from CDC and WHO protocols to support contact tracing and case
    investigation. Users are able to register and track suspected cases, confirmed
    cases, and cases’ contacts, and follow-up for a period of required days.
    Additional template applications have been developed for port of entry
    surveillance, facility readiness, and lab test tracking. Currently, these
    applications are being used by governments around the world, including the city of
    <a href="{% url 'blog_post' 'sf-ucsf-contact-tracing-announcement'%}"
       target="_blank">San Francisco</a>,
    the state of Alaska, and countries such as Togo,

       target="_blank">Sierra Leone</a>, and Madagascar.
