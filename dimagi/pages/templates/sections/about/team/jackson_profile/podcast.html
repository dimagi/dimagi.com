                Rowena Luk chats with Jonathan about the influences, people,
                and ideas that took him from being an MIT grad on Wall Street
                to building health systems in Zambia. As they reflect on
                Dimagi’s founding story, you’ll also hear Jonathan’s conscious
                decision to be an idealist and an activist – in spite of the
                existential doubts that plague him to this day.

              Today we’re talking to Jonathan Jackson, Co-Founder and CEO of
              Dimagi. And we discuss how Dimagi built out tech for contact
              tracing and data processing during the pandemic. How Dimagi
              has augmented their engineering teams by working with Caktus
              Group over the years, and tips for approaching each new
              task with curiosity.
