          A literature review by RTI International found that a community health
          worker model will improve health outcomes for underserved or
          low-resource communities depending on the health conditions they face.
          For instance, CHW interventions were found to have the greatest effect
          compared to alternatives when used for disease prevention, asthma
          management, cervical cancer screening, and mammography screening outcomes.
