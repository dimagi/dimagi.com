        Once lab-confirmed cases are identified, the system users input
        information about these casesâ€™ contacts. These contacts then receive
        daily SMS text messages checking in on their health and symptoms
        throughout the 14-day monitoring period. They can self-report
        symptoms via text, immediately alerting public health officials
        that follow up or testing may be required. This system does not
        collect information about contacts' GPS locations.
