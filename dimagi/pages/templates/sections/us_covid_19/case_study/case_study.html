            Dimagi is partnering with state and local governments across the
            United States. One of our projects, with the San Francisco Department
            of Public Health in California, University of California at SanFrancisco (UCSF),
            and the CDC, recently deployed a variation of the US COVID-19 Local Response System.
            The system was rapidly developed using <a href="{{ commcare }}">CommCare</a>,
            allowing Department of Public Health officials and UCSF public health officials,
            students, and librarians to easily track both COVID-19 cases and contacts over time.
