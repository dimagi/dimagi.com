            Dimagi is partnering with state and local governments across the
            United States. One of our projects, with the San Francisco Department
            of Public Health in California, University of California at SanFrancisco (UCSF),
            and the CDC, recently deployed a variation of the US COVID-19 Local Response System.
            The system was rapidly developed using <a href="{{ commcare }}">CommCare</a>,
            allowing Department of Public Health officials and UCSF public health officials,
            students, and librarians to easily track both COVID-19 cases and contacts over time.

              In the midst of an unprecedented disease outbreak, experience
              matters. While there were no pandemic-ready, turn-key contact
              tracing systems available, the Philadelphia Department of Public
              Health benefited from the expertise Dimagi gained from developing
              COVID-19 data systems for public health agencies. We are pleased
              with the COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing application
              they built for us in their CommCare software system and feel it has
              facilitated our ability to respond to the pandemic.
