            Mobile data collection has been proven to aid the maternal and child health sector. Research has shown it to increase antenatal care by 41% and improve facility delivery rates by over 100%. Programs featuring mobile data collection have also seen family members participate more in antenatal care, with husbands engaging 60% and mothers-in-law 110% more often than in paper-based programs.

            Organizations are using mobile data collection platform to digitize the partograph and ICMI to allow programs to keep track of pregnancies and clinic visits, diagnose any issues from data collected, and offer advice to mothers and their families on what to expect faster and more accurately than ever before.

            More projects on CommCare are focused on maternal and child health than any other sector. In fact, our platform registers one in every 110 pregnancies worldwide.
