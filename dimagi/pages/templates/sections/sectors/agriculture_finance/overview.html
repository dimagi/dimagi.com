            The explosion of microfinance and insurance institutions (MFIs) 
            has provided alternative sources of capital and security for 
            small-scale farmers. Availability to Microfinance and insurance 
            options allow agricultural communities to reduce investment 
            risk, as well as provide the growth capital needed to thrive.

            However, while microfinance and insurance have allowed farmers 
            to increase crop yields through new investments, the penetration 
            rates in rural rates — where capital and risk hedging is needed 
            most — still lag behind other geographies. Complex dataflows and 
            poor infrastructures lead to impossible demands on finance, 
            insurance, and credit officers. Only robust, off-grid IT solutions 
            can help expand financial tools to the millions that require 
            them to help expand their businesses.
