            Malnutrition is disproportionately prevalent in poor, rural regions and
            developing countries. Nutrition efforts are often coordinated via large,
            integrated paper-based systems, and often lack real-time data.

            Mobile technology can overcome these problems and support these nutrition
            programs, such as Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP), Community-based
            Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM), and Positive Deviance/Hearth (PD/H).

            CommCare tracks 10% of malnourished children in India, and 1 in 50 malnourished
            children in world. Platform helps programs diagnose problems 41% faster than
            paper tools, so community health workers spend more time registering new patients
            & administering better care to the ones they have.
