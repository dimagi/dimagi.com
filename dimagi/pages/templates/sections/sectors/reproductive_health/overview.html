            When women are empowered to make informed decisions regarding their family planning needs,
            their families are more economically secure, educated, and healthy. Yet, it is estimated that
            worldwide there are 215 million women and girls whose family planning needs are not being met.
            As a result, 75 million unplanned pregnancies each year lead to negative health outcomes for
            both women and their families.

            Dimagi and our partners have been working together to develop programs and technologies
            that increase womenâ€™s access to reproductive health care. By using mobile applications,
            CHWs are better able to share sensitive messages, track family planning commodities, &
            ensure safe & efficient follow-ups with patients after procedures.
