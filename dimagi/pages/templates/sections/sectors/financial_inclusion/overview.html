            Financial inclusion programs provide access to and delivery of
            basic banking services, including savings, lending, insurance, and
            other financial services, to everyone in the population â€” especially
            those who live below the poverty line.

            Financial inclusion is an important issue in low- and middle-income
            countries (LMICs), where limited access to education, communications
            services, and financial services can pose significant challenges. Barriers
            to inclusivity in remote settings, such as distance from a financial
            service provider, lack of trust in financial service providers, low
            financial literacy rates, or the high cost of making low-value
            transactions,are all serious obstacles.

            The use of mobile technologies is growing exponentially in LMICs, and
            digital financial inclusion has never been more possible than it is
            today. Many donors, iNGOs, and governments have identified it as one
            of the key enablers for sustainable economic growth by allowing the
            unbanked to attain financial services and break out of the poverty cycle.
