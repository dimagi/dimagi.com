              the spread of the disease. CommCare improved the Government of
              Guinea’s ability to identify, track, and monitor people at risk
              for Ebola in real-time, provided access to epidemiological data
              from difficult-to-reach communities, and allowed for stronger
              accountability of surveillance processes – ultimately helping
              us to keep up with a fast-spreading and dangerous epidemic.”
