            Many small businesses have recently entered the market by employing 
            vendors to sell poverty-alleviating products at the Bottom of the 
            Economic Pyramid (BoP), including cook stoves, pay toilets, 
            tampons, and solar lanterns.

            These products often pay for themselves through reduced fuel and 
            healthcare expenditures, while reducing disease and increasing 
            access to education. However, in order to achieve profitability at 
            scale and to expand access to these products, businesses need 
            tools that help increase sales penetration, expand their market 
            size, and sustain product innovation. Thatâ€™s where mobile 
            technology comes in.
