            Cooperative farming holds the most potential for rural farmers 
            to lift themselves out of poverty through their collective 
            expertise and combined efficiencies. For many farmers, discounts 
            on inputs and increased market access have resulted in 
            unprecedented increases in income.

            However, cooperatives become exponentially more complex to manage 
            as they scale. The administrative burden of large memberships 
            creates an artificial limitation to their size. Management 
            applications and mobile tools help cooperatives reduce this 
            management burden, allowing them to dramatically increase 
            memberships without increasing complexity.
