                  Dimagi is working with UGPCL to help better manage their 
                  cooperative of over 1,000 farmers. Cooperative supervisors 
                  track the entire value-chain of small-scale farmers from 
                  the initial loan through its repayment, the output and 
                  quality of crops during the growing season, the farm 
                  produce’s contract sale for processing, as well as value 
                  addition by third parties. By providing a mobile-based 
                  system for tracking key metrics, cooperative managers can 
                  make informed decisions about the future of their 
                  cooperative, as well as estimate future cash flow 
                  requirements based on yield and sales data. Examples of 
                  features in the application include tools to help farmers 
                  calculate planting density, step-by-step guidance that helps 
                  farmers prepare for harvest, GPS tracking, and a module with 
                  instructional videos about how to use the application.

                  CARE India Solutions for Sustainable Development (CISSD) 
                  partnered with Dimagi as part of its Pathways program to 
                  enable more productive and more equitable participation of 
                  women farmers in sustainable agriculture and to contribute 
                  to their empowerment. To support this effort, they created 
                  the Participatory Performance Tracker, a CommCare-based 
                  mobile app that tracks individual farmers’ adoption of 
                  program-supported best practices, as well as their overall 
                  output. CISSD is inspired by the vital roles that women play 
                  in smallholder agriculture, meeting the food needs of their 
                  households and communities and contributing to development 
                  and growth, and believe the Pathways program and its 
                  Participatory Performance Tracker will improve livelihoods 
                  for women in even the most marginalized communities.
