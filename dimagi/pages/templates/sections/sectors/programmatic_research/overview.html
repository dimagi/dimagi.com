            Since 2002, researchers have been using Dimagi’s open-source mobile 
            technologies to bring efficiency, visibility, and scalability to 
            their field-based studies.

            Universities and organizations conducting field-based international 
            research face unique challenges with data collection, monitoring, 
            and program implementation. Research teams have to address the 
            coordination and integration of multiple paper-based tools, field 
            deployment organizations, training of local staff, and a variety of 
            country-specific logistical considerations. The team is often only 
            on-site for a short amount of time and then may need to manage 
            long-term initiatives remotely.

            Fortunately, mobile tools can help. Their forms are easily 
            configurable, allowing for quick, remote adjustments. Their 
            platform approach makes scaling to multiple sites a breeze. 
            Longitudinal data management allows subjects to be tracked over 
            time. Here’s what mobile tools can do for your next research project.
